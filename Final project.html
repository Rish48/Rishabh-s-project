        <center> <p id="p1">A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Rishabh'a restauraut has been around since 1987, which means it is 35 years old. Rishabh's restaurant serves food and drinks to customers. Our food is great tasting, and for a very cheap price!</p></center>
